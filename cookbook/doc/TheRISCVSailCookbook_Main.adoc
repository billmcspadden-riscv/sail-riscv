[#list_of_programming_examples]
== List of programming examples (in increasing complexity)

The main purpose of this document,  is to give the user a set
of programming examples for working on the RISC-V Sail model
(often referred to as the RISC-V Golden Model).  The examples
will show the user how to change or extend the model.  And it
will also show the user how to write a RISC-V program (in both 
assembler and C) and then run it on the Golden Model.

You should read and utilize this document after you have a good
handle on the Sail programming language.

== Introduction



== How to contribute (Bill)


=== Coding and indentation style


=== Brevity

Program examples should be short, both in terms of number-of-lines and in terms of execution time.  
Each example should focus on one simple item.  And the execution of the example item should be clear.  
The example should be short, standalone and easy to maintain.


=== Maintainership (when something breaks)

We would also ask that if you contribute a code example,  that you would maintain it.

== Sail installation

== Basic description
=== What Sail is
Sail is a programming language that is targetted for
 specifying an ISA.  Once specified, a set of
instructions (usually found in a .elf file) can then
be executed on the "model" and the results observed.

The model is a sequential model only;  at this time, 
there are no semantics allowing for any type of parallel
execution.  

=== What sail is not 
Sail is not an RTL (Register Transfer Language).
There is no direct support for timing (as in clock
timing) and there is no support for parallel execution,
all things that an RTL contains.

=== version management and what to expect
TBD

== Colophon

This document was prepared on an Ubuntu Linux workstation 
using Microsofts VSCode for editing and rendering the asciidoc
text.

+'shutter'+ was used for screenshots of various parts of the RISCV 
specifications and were saved in PNG format.

These screenshots were then edited using +'gimp'+ to highlight the
pertinent sections of the screenshot.

+'asciidoctor-reducer'+ was used to combine and resolve all cross-document
references and put them into one .adoc file,  TheRISCVSailCookbook_Complate.adoc.

The pdf was created using +'asciidoctor-pdf'+ .

See the Makefile, +cookbook/doc/Makefile+,  for the recipe for building
the document.
